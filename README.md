# BThack

BThack client for minecraft.
This is a very simple cheat client that was my first project while learning java. It's still not fully finished, so I can't guarantee 100% functionality of all features. BThack is currently an abandoned project, although I may return to its development in the future.


# How to instal

1.Download the zip archive, unzip it and open it in Intellij Idea.
<p>
2.Wait until the initialization is complete. Then reload gradle.
