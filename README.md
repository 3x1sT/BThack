# BThack

BThack cheat client for minecraft. This is a very simple cheat client, which was my first project while learning java. It is still not completely finished, so I can't guarantee 100% functionality of all features.


# How to instal

1.Download the zip archive, unzip it and open it in Intellij Idea.
<p>
2.Wait until the initialization is complete. Then reload gradle.
